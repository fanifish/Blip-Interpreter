// BSTMap.h an implementation of binary search trees as a template

/*
 * A "map" is an abstract data structure that functions like a "dictionary". You store
 * information in the map (like definitions of words) and then use keys (i.e., the words themselves)
 * to retrieve that information. Our CustomerDB was a map. In that context, we used Strings (names)
 * as the keys, and we used Customer records as the information. 
 *
 * When a map is implemented as a standalone data structure, it typically separates the
 * key and value completely. So, unlike our CustomerDB where the key was Customer::name
 * (i.e., the key was a data component in the Customer struct), in a standalone map
 * the key will be a separate type.
 *
 * Maps can be based on Binary Search Trees, on Hash Tables or even on Vectors.
 * This implementation is a Binary Search Tree based map. However, you can use a map
 * in exactly the same way regardless of the physical data structure it is built on.
 *
 * The primary operations for a map are:
 *	BSTMap<KeyType, ValueType> myMap; // constructor -- creates an emtpy map
 *		Note that KeyType will be some type (e.g., String), and that will be the data type
 *		you use for all your keys. Similarly ValueType will be a type, and that will be the
 *		data type you use for all your information. For the CustomerDB, the KeyType would
 *		have been String, and the ValueType would have been Customer
 *  myMap.isMember(key) -- // checks to see if a key is stored in the map. For example
 *		you can check to see if there is a mapping for the String "Craig" with
 *		myMap.isMember("Craig") -- naturally this assumes that String is your KeyType
 *  myMap.insert(key, value) -- a low-level insert function. If key is not in the map already
 *		then key is added to the map and is stored with "value". If key is already in the map
 *		then the mapping for that key is changed -- the old mapping is deleted and the key
 *		now maps to value
 *	myMap[key] = value -- same as insert(key, value)
 *  ValueType v = myMap[key] -- reads the current mapping for key and stores it in v
   myMap.remove(key) -- removes any mapping stored for key. If there is no mapping for key
 *		then remove does not do anything.
 * 
 * BSTMap<KeyType, ValueType>::Iterator p = myMap.get_iterator()
 *		The get_iterator function returns an EE312-style iterator object for scanning the
 *		map. The iterator's type is a nested type called Iterator. So, to declare your
 *		iterator, you must use the full type of the map (including the KeyTypes and ValueTypes)
 *		and then append ::Iterator to that name. The get_iterator() function starts the scan
 *		at a reasonable starting point for the map (for trees, at the smallest key)
 *		To scan the entire map:
 *
 *		for (BSTMap<KeyType, ValueType>::Iterator p = myMap.get_iterator();
 *				! p.done(); p.advance()) {
 *			KeyType key = p->key;
 *			ValueType val = p->value;
 *		}
 * 
 *		Note that the iterator behaves sort of like a pointer, and you can read both
 *      the key and value stored at each mapping. You can use the iterator to change
 *      the value in any mapping. However, if you assign a new key using the iterator
 *      bad things may happen to your map.
 *			p->value = new_value; // OK
 *			p->key = new_key; // really, really bad.
 *
 * Finally, the map has a destructor, copy-constructor and (re)assignment operator
 * so you can make copies as you wish.
